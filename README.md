## A small introduction to Computer Vision

Computer vision is the part of Artificial Intelligence whose objective is to train machines to be able to understand the world and environment in a visual way. The objective of developing technologies around Machine Vision and Computer Vision is to get the same accuracy interpreting images and scenes as the accuracy that a human brain can have. With Machine Vision  and Computer Vision the machines are able to understand and react to what they are observing. Some examples of the use of Machine and Computer Vision are the self-driving cars. The self-driving cars , they need to observe, to evaluate, to classify, to forecast and react to what they are witnessing, In this workshop, you will know about some of the real word applications that Computer Vision has as well as about the process and technologies behind them.

During the Workshop at McGill Learnathon 2021, I presented a small piece of code that was meant to attract the attention of the youngest in the very interesting field of Computer Vision and Image processing. I presented a code that could demystify the "invisibility cloak of Harry Potter".
